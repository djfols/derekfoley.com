    description: "During my undergraduate career, I served as an intern for Boards and Commissions. Upon graduation, I was offered a full time position as a constituent aide for the Governor. I learned a great deal about how government works (and doesn't work) in this position. Most days I simply talked to people about the Governor's positions on legislation and issues or redirecting them to various agencies to assist them with some issue they were having. It was 60% people interested in information, 20% elderly women requesting a signed picture of the Governor, and 20% people who wanted to yell at someone."

    description: "During graduate school, I noticed that the current methods for measuring gravitational acceleration were outdated. Geologists measure variances in the gravitational acceleration on Earth to learn about the subsurface. The current method is to use a very delicate device called a gravimeter. The gravimeter is comprised of a dial, a quartz spring (that costs over fifty grand), and a lever. The sping and lever react to small changes in gravity, allowing for measurement of the gravitational acceleration. I developed a far more accurate method that measures the eigenstates of neutrons in a linear potential.",

    description: "My thesis, \"Analysis of the Point Pleasant/Lexington/Trenton Formations: Sulfides, Mineralogy, and Trace Elements as Geochemical Proxies\", defined the mineralogical, petrophysical, and geochemical characters of the Point Pleasant/Lexington/Trenton formations in Eastern Ohio. In addition, how redox states vary with the character of the formations. Using mineralogy, sulfides, and trace elements, I concluded that the Point Pleasant, Lexington, and Trenton Formations formed in variable redox conditions, with oxygenated bottom waters followed by abrupt reducing, anoxic conditions.",

    description: "As a geologist for the Ohio Geological Survey, I assisted ongoing projects through sampling, data acquisition, and analysis. I used ArcGIS and Petra to study and produce structure and isopach maps of valuable formations in Ohio and presented findings and gave educational talks about Ohio geology to industry and the public. I served as a principle geologist on a project to map the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian unconformity in Ohio, a critical marker for drillers of hydrocarbons and groundwater."

So far, I have completed The Complete Web and App Developer Course by Rob Percival and The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp and The Complete 2020 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart courses by Angela Yu on Udemy, built a couple Flutter apps, and built this website. I am continuing to learn new languages and build my skills as a developer while seeking new opportunities."
